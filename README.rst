Development
===========

Coding style
------------

This repository follows a custom coding style, which can be validated anytime
using the repository's provided `configuration file <.phpcs>`_.

Setup of the development environment
------------------------------------

To get started, make sure you have a working set of the following components:

* gromox-http
* gromox-zcore
* php-mapi
* nginx

Checkout the repository into a new directory, e.g.
``/usr/share/grommunio-web-dev``.

If you want to use the existing grommunio-web config, point ``config.php`` to
it:

.. code-block:: sh

	ln -s /etc/grommunio-web/config.php /usr/share/grommunio-web-dev/config.php

or use the ``config.php.dist`` file:

.. code-block:: sh

	cp -p /usr/share/grommunio-web-dev/config.php.dist /usr/share/grommunio-web-dev/config.php

If you want to use the existing grommunio-web defaults, copy the ``defaults.php`` file:

.. code-block:: sh

	cp -p /usr/share/grommunio-web/defaults.php /usr/share/grommunio-web-dev/defaults.php

Make sure to adjust ``/usr/share/grommunio-web-dev/defaults.php`` to
use sources instead of the release variant as follows: Search forâ€¦

.. code-block:: php

	if (!defined('DEBUG_LOADER')) define('DEBUG_LOADER', LOAD_RELEASE);

and replace it with

.. code-block:: php

	if (!defined('DEBUG_LOADER')) define('DEBUG_LOADER', LOAD_SOURCE);

For debugging purposes it might make sense to enable ``debug.php`` file:

.. code-block:: sh

	cp -p /usr/share/grommunio-web-dev/debug.php.dist /usr/share/grommunio-web-dev/debug.php

At last, adjust (or copy) the nginx config file
``/usr/share/grommunio-common/nginx/locations.d/grommunio-web.conf`` by
replacing

.. code-block:: text

	alias /usr/share/grommunio-web/;

with

.. code-block:: text

	alias /usr/share/grommunio-web-dev/;

After changing the configuration, validate your nginx configuration with
the ``nginx -t`` command and reload with ``systemctl reload nginx``.

Translations
============

For performance reasons, the languages are loaded into the shared memory of the
running system. After changes to the translation files, re-generate the gettext
strings (see ``Makefile``) and make sure you clear the shared memory segment
for the cache:

.. code-block:: sh

	ipcrm -M 0x950412de

The translations are managed through a `Weblate project
<https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/grommunio/grommunio-web/>`_. Contributions
are regularly monitored and integrated in the release cycles of grommunio Web.
