## Development

### Coding style

This repository follows a customized coding style. The coding style can be validated anytime by the repositories provided [configuration file](.phpcs).

### Setup development environment

To get started, make sure you have a working set of the following components:

- gromox-http
- gromox-zcore
- php-mapi
- nginx

Checkout the repository into a new directory, e.g. "/usr/share/grommunio-web-dev". The new path of grommunio-web is now "/usr/share/grommunio-web-dev/".

If you want to use the existing grommunio-web config, point config.php to it: ```ln -s /etc/grommunio-web/config.php /opt/grommunio-web/config.php``` or use the "config.php.dist": ```cp -p /usr/share/grommunio-web-dev/config.php.dist /usr/share/grommunio-web-dev/config.php```.

Also, copy the defaults.php: ```ln -s /etc/grommunio-web/defaults.php /opt/grommunio-web/defaults.php``` or use the "defaults.php.dist": ```cp -p /usr/share/grommunio-web-dev/defaults.php.dist /usr/share/grommunio-web-dev/defaults.php```. Finally, make sure to adjust "/usr/share/grommunio-web-dev/defaults.php" to use sources instead of the release version. Search for ```if(!defined('DEBUG_LOADER')) define('DEBUG_LOADER', LOAD_RELEASE);``` and replace it with ```if(!defined('DEBUG_LOADER')) define('DEBUG_LOADER', LOAD_SOURCE);```. 

At last, adjust (or copy) the nginx config file "/usr/share/grommunio-common/nginx/locations.d/grommunio-web.conf" by replacing ```alias /usr/share/grommunio-web/;``` with ```alias /usr/share/grommunio-web-dev/;```. Reload nginx: ```systemctl reload nginx```.

## Translators

For performance reasons, the languages are loaded into the shared memory of the running system. After translation changes, re-generate the gettext strings (see _Makefile_) and make sure you clear the shared memory:

```
ipcrm -M 0x950412de
```

The translations are managed by [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/grommunio/grommunio-web/). Contributions are regularly monitored and integrated in the release cycles of grommunio Web.
